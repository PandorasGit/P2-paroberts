## Project Report: Iteration 1

### Reflection
***
This project I found an issue I didn't think possible. I was well ahead and meeting requirements at a very good pace, but I constantly felt as if I wasn't working hard enough on it. This ever constant feeling that I hadn't put in enough work on it has lead to a lot of extra features that I didn't expect to have time to develop. I believe I felt like I could go even further with this project still and make not just a game with a clear start and end, but a game I have a longer experience than it being a techical show case.
